Summary

This tool uses both python and perl to establish communications with Tenable.SC and FMC to add vulnerability scan data (from Tneable SS) to the Host profile in FMC.
It is inspired by project https://github.com/QuiLoxx/ATS-APIs/tree/master/firepower/neipatel_securityCenter-HostInput/v1
Initial project was not updated in a few years and there were some changes on the Tenable.SC API functionality
pyTenable is intended to be a pythonic interface into the Tenable application APIs: https://github.com/tenable/pyTenable

Files

import_vuln.py

Dependencies

from tenable.sc import TenableSC
import threading
import subprocess
import time
import ConfigParser

Usage
The script is fed by one user configurable file: “config.cfg” These are the variables used to define the details of the Security Center and FMC that will be used
Fo username and password it is best to read them from environment variables or in a .env file:

[UserVariables]
username = <security center username>
password = <security center password>
address = <security center IP/Hostname>
debug = True
ip_range = 10.0.0.0/8
page_size = 100
fmc = 192.168.207.135
delay = <time in seconds between update runs>
quiet = <True or False, defines if command output is noisy or quiet>

EXAMPLE CONFIG FILE
[UserVariables]
username = administrator-api
password = thisisthepassword
address = securitycenter.acme.com
debug = False
ip_range = 192.168.1.0/24
page_size = 100
fmc = fmc.acme.com
delay = 1200
quiet = True

It is recommended to leave the debug parameter true to help with troubleshooting if you were to have issues.
Before running the following command ensure that all prerequisites are met and the *.pcks12 file from the FMC is in the same directory. To run the tool simply execute:

python import_vuln.py

or

./import_vuln.py
